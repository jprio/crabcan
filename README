Introduction to containers
Post n°1 of serie Writing a container in Rust
The objective of this series of blog post is to understand what is a container, how does it work and create a container to create and manage containers, from scratch in Rust. The implementation will be based on the amazing Linux containers in 500 lines of code tutorial, but rewritten in Rust.

First of all, to understand how we’re going to build our container, let’s figure out what is a container and why we need it, we’ll examine then few examples of containers commonly used.
